<p>Understand customer preferences is crucial for delivering personalized experiences in any industry. In this post,

The user-item matrix can be visualized as a table below, where each row corresponds to a distinct user, and each column represents an item.
Within this matrix, the numerical value in each cell shows the user's sentiment or <span class='highlight'> preference score </ span> towards the respective item, indicating how much they like or dislike it.

<p>
Note that <span class='highlight'> an empty cell </span> in the user-item matrix means no prior interaction between the user and the item.
In the world of <span style='font-weight: bold;'>recommender systems</span>, there is an interest in predicting how much a user will like or dislike items they have never interacted with before.
However, this topic goes beyond the scope of this post, as we will focus on understanding the current preferences of the user.

            font-weight: bold;
        }
</style>
<p>
The scores in the matrix generally come from two sources:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <span class='highlight'>Explicit scores</span> added by users
        <ul>
            <li>Upvotes or downvotes 👍🏻 👎🏻 on platforms like Netflix</li>
            <li>Rating score ranging from 1 to 5, for instance ⭐️⭐️⭐️</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Scores derived <span class='highlight'>from user behaviors</span>, which are implicit in nature
        <ul>
            <li>Views, adding to cart 🛒, purchases, and more</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
Keep in mind that explicit scores may not always accurately reflect users' true opinions.
Various external factors, such as social pressure or influence from friends, can impact how users rate items.
Moreover, low scores might be influenced by factors unrelated to the product itself, such as delivery delays or damaged packaging.

<p>
While explicit scores are obtained by directly asking users to rate items, we will shift our focus to implicit scores, which are more complex in nature. Implicit scores are derived from user behaviors and interactions, making them a valuable indicator of user preferences.
</p>
<p>
To compute implicit scores, it can be seen as an attempt to infer the scores that users would assign to the content they have interacted with, such as viewing, streaming, or making purchases.

BINARY USER-ITEM MATRIX
</span>
<p>
In the user-item matrix, each cell contains a value of 1 if the user has made a purchase for that particular item, and a value of 0 if there is no purchase history for that item by the user.
In the table below, it is indicated that customer 2 has made a purchase of lip balm, but there are no records of purchases for oil and cleanser by customer 2.

<span class='highlight'>
EVENT-BASED USER-ITEM MATRIX
</span>
<p>
Using only purchase or non-purchase events in your matrix can result in a sparse matrix with many empty cells.
To address this limitation, event-based approaches come into play by incorporating user interactions such as views, adding items to the cart, wishlisting, or any other relevant events.
